Course Website:   https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/425185
The videos linked on the course website are background information on the assignments that may help you complete them.
Goals: This course focuses on implementing Digital Signal Processing ideas and techniques on real-time hardware. At the end of the course, it is expected that you will be able to implement signal-processing tasks on real-time hardware.
Grading: All based on Weekly Assignments and a Final Project, No Midterm/Final exams
Weekly assignments: 10% for each one, totally 80%.          Final Project: 20%
Weekly Assignments: Each week has an associated programming assignment. Each assignment is due by 11:59pm Friday the following week. Assignments will be graded based on the correctness of output and the clarity of your code.   Most of the assignments are available at the start of the semester and if you are ambitious, you could have all of the work for the class done early in the semester.
Final Project: TBD
